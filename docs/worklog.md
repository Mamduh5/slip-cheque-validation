# Worklog

## 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Initialized a new Next.js TypeScript App Router project in an empty repository.
- Added Tailwind, ESLint, TypeScript, and base app configuration.
- Added auth scaffold with email/password registration, credentials login, optional Google login, JWT sessions, and protected routes.
- Added MongoDB helpers, user/document/audit model types, and document service functions.
- Added MinIO object storage helper with lazy bucket creation.
- Added upload API route with server-side metadata, MIME type, and size validation.
- Added pages for landing, login, register, dashboard, upload, and document detail/result.
- Added Dockerfile and Docker Compose services for app, MongoDB, and MinIO.
- Added README and documentation under `docs/`.
- Upgraded to Next.js 16 and added a PostCSS override so production audit reports zero vulnerabilities.

### Key Decisions

- V1 remains a single web app instead of split frontend/backend services.
- Document intake is shared across transfer slips, deposit/payment slips, cheques, and unknown documents.
- Duplicate matching is represented in the data model but not implemented yet.
- MinIO stores original image files; MongoDB stores metadata and processing state.
- Google sign-in is optional and disabled in the UI when OAuth env values are missing.

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm audit --omit=dev`
- `docker compose up -d --build`
- `GET /api/health`

### Assumptions

- Local development will usually run through Docker Compose.
- Uploads are limited to JPEG, PNG, and WebP for the initial scaffold.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` should be supplied before meaningful local use.
- Exact SHA-256 hash is safe to compute during upload for v1.

### Pending Items

- Add automated tests.
- Implement exact duplicate lookup.
- Add image preview and richer upload progress.
